/**
 * Generic encoding tools
 *
 * Description:
 * This module works with any encoder and decoder structs that implement 
 * the following basic interfaces:
 * ---
 * struct Encoder
 * {
 *     // Encodes a Unicode code point to user-provided buffer.
 *     // Should return bytes written or 0 at error
 *     size_t encode(uint codePoint, char[] buffer)
 * }
 *
 * struct Decoder
 * {
 *     // An input range that iterates characters of a string, 
 *     // decoding them to Unicode code points
 *     auto decode(string input)
 * }
 * ---
